## Working as a Ross Counselor

The Ross Program will hire several counselors to work at the online program planned for 2022. 
Each counselor is expected to be available during the entire six weeks of the Program: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; mid-June &nbsp;through&nbsp; July 2022.   

Application materials for the 2022 session were posted **in January.** 
Look for updates at [Apply](to-apply/). <br>

## Application Requirements

A Ross Counselor needs a strong background in mathematics, and good social skills. 
We prefer applicants who are either math graduate students or undergraduate math majors 
who have completed at least two years of college. Applicants are expected to have completed a 
college course on Abstract Algebra, and to have some experience with elementary number theory.  
Prior knowledge of all the [Course Topics](/students/course-topics/) is not required.

Each counselor needs to pass a standard background check. Depending on your citizenship status, 
you might need to obtain an appropriate US visa to earn a salary at the Ross Program.
Note: Visas are very hard to obtain for non-US citizens who are not attending college in the USA.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to 
race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnic origin, 
disability status, or protected veteran status.

## Counselor Responsibilities

Counselors are role models for the younger students. Each counselor leads daily Zoom meetings 
with a group of 5 students, and evaluates (grades) the mathematical work they submit, 
providing gentle hints and advice to help inspire students to focus on their math problems. 
Counselors also participate in one or two math courses at more advanced levels, and are 
also encouraged to organize and present their own Zoom lectures on mathematical topics of interest.

## Compensation

In exchange for six weeks of work, the Ross Foundation provides each counselor with 
a salary. We expect to offer a base salary of $4000 for six weeks of work, with 
opportunities to earn extra pay for additional duties as needed.
