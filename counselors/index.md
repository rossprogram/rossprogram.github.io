## Working as a Ross Counselor

The Ross/USA Program will hire several counselors to work at the in-person program planned for 2023. Each counselor is expected to be available during the entire six weeks of the Program: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; mid-June &nbsp;through&nbsp; July 2023.   

Application materials for the 2023 session were posted **in January.** 
Look for updates at [Apply](to-apply/). <br>

## Application Requirements

A Ross Counselor needs a strong background in mathematics, and good social skills. 
We prefer applicants who are either math graduate students or undergraduate math majors 
who have completed at least two years of college. Applicants are expected to have completed a 
college course on Abstract Algebra, and to have some experience with elementary number theory.  
Prior knowledge of all the [Course Topics](/students/course-topics/) is not required.

Each counselor needs to pass a standard background check. Depending on your citizenship status, 
you might need to obtain an appropriate US visa to earn a salary at the Ross Program.
Note: Visas are very hard to obtain for non-US citizens who are not attending college in the USA.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to 
race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnic origin, 
disability status, or protected veteran status.

## Counselor Responsibilities

Ross Counselors are role models for the younger students. Each counselor leads meetings 
with a group of 5 students and evaluates (grades) the mathematical work they submit. 
Counselors provide gentle hints and advice to help inspire students to focus on their math problems. 
Counselors participate in one or two math courses at more advanced levels, and are 
encouraged to organize and present their own lectures on mathematical topics of interest.

## Compensation

In exchange for six weeks of work at Ross/USA, Ross counselors receive a base salary of $4500.  
There will be opportunities for additional pay as extra tasks arise.
