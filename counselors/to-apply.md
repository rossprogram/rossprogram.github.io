If you are interested in becoming a Ross Counselor, you may [find the applications for 2023 here](https://www.mathprograms.org/db?joblist-83) which became available on January 1, 2023.  There are multiple sites to choose from and you may apply to one or more locations, i.e., you may [apply to the Ohio location](https://www.mathprograms.org/db/programs/1398) or [apply to the Indiana location](https://www.mathprograms.org/db/programs/1399) or [apply to the tentatively planned location in the Philippines](https://www.mathprograms.org/db/programs/1400).

NOTES:
(1) Those applicants who were counselors in a previous year are not required to submit another letter of recommendation.
