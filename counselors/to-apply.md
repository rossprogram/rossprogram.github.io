If you are interested in becoming a Ross Counselor, you may [find the applications for 2023 here](https://www.mathprograms.org/db?joblist-83) which became available on January 1, 2023.  There are multiple sites to choose from and you may apply to one or more locations.

NOTES:
(1) Those applicants who were counselors in the 2022 program are not required to submit another letter of recommendation.

(2) The Ross Hiring Committee reads counselor applications **during February.**  They expect to make some initial job offers in early March.  To be considered in that first round, please submit your application by the end of February.
