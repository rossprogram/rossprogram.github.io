### MEDICAL INFORMATION.  

First, complete the Medical Authirization form sent to you via
HelloSign.  That form asks for some of your health history, current
medications, emergency contact information (parents phone numbers),
and provides permission for doctors to treat you in case of injuries
or illnesses during your time here.

Then, scan the front and back of your medical insurance card, and
email the resulting PDF file to <medical@rossprogram.org> , with the
subject line "insurance card" followed by the name of the student.
   
Ross participants must have health insurance that protects 
them from major expenses due to medical emergencies.  
Such events are very rare, but can happen.  Someone might 
have an accident or illness that results in tens of thousands 
of dollars of fees for hospitals and doctors. 

The Ross Program's insurance requirement is fulfilled if 
your current insurance policy covers "emergency medical care" 
in Ohio, even if it does not cover routine care. Of course you 
are welcome to purchase additional insurance if desired.

<b>Do not already have insurance? </b> <br>
Many companies offer short term insurance policies that cover 
major medical expenses.  Costs vary depending on the deductible, 
maximum coverage, and extras (like coverage during your travel).
For example, see the various companies and policies listed at: 
&nbsp;   [Visitors Coverage](https://www.visitorscoverage.com/) .

Some Chinese participants purchased insurance policies 
valid in the USA through the 
<i>Ping An Property & Casualty Insurance Company of China</i>, 
or the <i>People’s Insurance Company of China</i>.

Please let us know if you are having difficulty arranging for such medical insurance.
