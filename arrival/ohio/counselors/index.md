Welcome to counselors at the 2022 <b> Ross/Ohio Mathematics Program. </b>

## Travel

Counselors need to arrive at our dormitory in Columbus <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>before noon on Monday, June 13.</b>

- FLYING to the Columbus Airport (CMH):  Staff members will 
meet Ross participants as they arrive.  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Counselor meeting will begin with dinner on Monday, June 13. <br>

- DRIVING: Here are [Driving Directions](/materials/driving-directions-ohio.pdf) to 
Ohio Dominican University.

- DEPARTURE: The final lecture, awards presentations, and goodbyes will be
completed by 11:00 on July 27.  Please plan your departing flights 
to leave that day after 2 PM.  Shuttles will get participants the airport more
than an hour before their flights. <br>

## What to Bring
Please read the [What to Bring](/materials/bring.pdf) document 
that is written for campers and their parents.  Counselors may ignore
the restriction on computers:  Please bring a laptop.

Note that Ross participants are enrolled in the University's linen service,
providing a clean towel, pillowcase, and sheets each week. Since they
do not provide pillows, you may either bring a pillow or purchase one
after you arrive. If you need more than one towel per week, you may
bring your own or purchase new ones, washing and drying your towels as needed.

REMINDER:  Bring your passport or equivalent identification documents.
That ID are required to complete the tax documents.

## Agreements for Campers
Ross campers and JCs are asked to read
[Program Rules](/materials/program-rules.pdf) 
and [Standards of Behavior](/materials/standards-of-behavior.pdf), and then
to sign the [Participation Agreement](/materials/participation-agreement.pdf). 
As a counselor, you do not need to sign that Agreement, and you may bring a computer. 
But you should be familiar with 
the content of those three documents because you will play a large role in ensuring 
that those Rules and Stndards are followed.
These issues will be discussed further during counselor meetings.

## Medical Information.  

You will be sent an email requesting medical information.

Scan the front and back of your medical insurance card, and email the
resulting PDF file to <medical@rossprogram.org> , with the subject
line "insurance card" followed by your name.
   
Ross participants must have health insurance that protects
them from major expenses due to medical emergencies.  
Such events are very rare, but can happen.  Someone might 
have an accident or illness that results in tens of thousands 
of dollars of fees for hospitals and doctors. 

The Ross Program's insurance requirement is fulfilled if 
your current insurance policy covers "emergency medical care" 
in Ohio, even if it does not cover routine care. Of course you 
are welcome to purchase additional insurance if desired.

<b>Do not already have insurance? </b> <br>
Many companies offer short term insurance policies that cover 
major medical expenses.  Costs vary depending on the deductible, 
maximum coverage, and extras (like coverage during your travel).
For example, see the various companies and policies listed at: 
&nbsp;   [Visitors Coverage](https://www.visitorscoverage.com/) .

Let us know if you are having difficulty arranging for such medical insurance.
