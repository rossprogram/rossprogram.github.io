![Arnold E. Ross, 1996]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Ross1996-13zbzcl.jpg "Arnold E. Ross, 1996"){:style="float: right; margin-left: 12pt;"}

Professor Arnold E. Ross founded his math program for high school students in 1957, 
and he continued to run it every summer until 2000\. Further information about 
his background and accomplishments is provided in a short 
[biography](/alumni/biography/ "Ross Biography") and a much longer [history](/alumni/history/).

From 2000 to 2018 the Ross Program was led by Daniel Shapiro.  Now Jim Fowler has taken over as Director, but Shapiro is still active as Director-Emeritus.

**Our [Sixtieth Anniversary Celebration](/alumni/reunions/60th-anniversary-2017/) was held in June 2017**.

A [Reunion-Conference](/alumni/reunions/2017/ "2017 – 60th Year") was held in Columbus on June 16 - 18, 2017\.  
Alumni and friends joined together to renew ties, reminisce, and meet current Ross participants.  
Previous Ross Reunion-Conferences were held in [1996](/alumni/reunions/1996/ "1996 – 90th Birthday") , 
[2001](/alumni/reunions/2001/ "2001 – 45th Year") , and [2007](/alumni/reunions/2007/).
