The application window for the 2023 *Ross Mathematics Program* is **now open.**

Begin your application by visiting [the application portal at https://apply.rossprogram.org/](https://apply.rossprogram.org/).

For full consideration, completed applications must be submitted before the end of March.  The Ross Admissions Committee will begin reading applications on April 1, and
admission decisions will be made later that month.

The 2023 Ross/USA Program will have in-person, six-week, residential sessions 
at two locations: <br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; at Otterbein University in Columbus; Ohio: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **June 11** (Sun) &nbsp;through&nbsp; **July 21**, 2023. <br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; **June 18** (Sun) &nbsp;through&nbsp; **July 28**, 2023. <br>

In addition, Renascentia Hall International is expected to run Ross/Asia, a five-week in-person residential program at the University of the Philippines Diliman in Manila similar to the Ross/USA experience.  This will be in 
Quezon City, Philippines:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **July 9** (Sun) &nbsp;through&nbsp; **August 11**, 2023. <br><br>
Participants from outside the Philippines should plan to arrive in 
Manila on Saturday July 8 (after noon), with departing flights on Friday 
evening August 11, or on Saturday August 12.

The hope is to accommodate 50 first-year students at each site.

# Introduction

The Ross Program is an intensive summer experience designed to encourage 
motivated pre-college students to explore mathematics. During those weeks, 
students are immersed in a world of mathematical discovery.

[Dr. Arnold Ross](/alumni/biography/ "Ross Biography") founded this 
multi-level program at Notre Dame University in 1957\. Its growth was 
then spurred by the launch of the Sputnik satellite and the subsequent 
surge of interest in science education. Arnold Ross’s Program has run 
every summer since then, associated mostly with Ohio State University 
from 1964 through 2018.  In 2019, the Program moved to 
<a href="http://www.ohiodominican.edu/"> Ohio Dominican University</a>.
In 2020 and 2021 the Ross Program was entirely online, but in-person sessions  resumed in 2022 at Ohio Dominican University and <a href="https://www.rose-hulman.edu/">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>.

Our central goal has always been to instruct bright young students in the art of mathematical thinking and to inspire them to discover for themselves that abstract ideas are valuable and important. First year participants take the basic course in number theory. For most students, this is the first time they are asked to consider entirely new questions, to develop methods that they have not seen before, and to justify every answer.

The value of a mathematics education lies not only in obtaining proficiency in computational tasks, but also in building a foundation for critical thinking. Students who have never asked why things work the way they do are not prepared to lead the way to future scientific innovation. It is precisely this independence of thought and questioning attitude that the Ross Program strives to nurture.

## Eligibility

Ambitious pre-college students with interests in mathematics and science are invited 
to [apply](/students/to-apply.md/). First-year students range in age from 15 to 18 years old. 
(In rare cases, younger or older students are accepted.)  Admission decisions are based 
on several criteria, including: school transcripts; teacher recommendations;  essays concerning the applicant’s interests and goals; and the applicant’s work on some challenging math problems. 

Undergraduate math majors and math graduate students are invited 
to [apply to be a Ross Counselor](/counselors/).

NOTE. The Ross Program cannot accommodate students who must arrive more than two days after the start of classes.

## Costs and Financial Aid

Each Ross student is asked to pay a program fee of $6000.  Those funds are used to pay for six weeks of room and board, to hire instructors and counselors, and to cover incidental costs of developing and running math courses. 

NOTE: [Financial aid](https://rossprogram.org/students/faq/#are-scholarships-available) 
is certainly available. Accepted applicants are encouraged to apply for aid if their families have some 
financial need. We hope to provide enough support to enable every 
accepted applicant to attend this great Program.   

## To Apply

The Ross Program application is posted on the [to apply](/students/to-apply.md/) page. 
For full consideration, completed applications must be submitted by March 31. 
The Ross Admissions Committee begins reading the application on April 1. <br>
Acceptance decisions will be made later in April, and the process will
be completed by May. 

The Ross Program admits students of any race, color, gender, and national or ethnic origin.
