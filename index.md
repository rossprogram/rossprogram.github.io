For the 2022 Ross Mathematics Program, the application window will be open in January 2022.  The Ross Admissions
Committee will start making acceptance decisions in March.

The 2021 Ross Mathematics Program was online, running from <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sunday **June 27** &nbsp; through &nbsp; Friday **August 6,** 2021

During those six weeks, all students attended synchronous lectures 
on Number Theory. To solve time zone challenges, those lectures were offered 
every weekday at 11 AM and again at 8 PM, Eastern Time.  In addition, 
participants attended small-group meetings every day to discuss the problem sets. 
Each group was guided by a Ross counselor.

NOTE: Some of the information below refers to the in-person Ross Program.  
More detailed plans for the online program will be sent to accepted participants. 

# Introduction

The Ross Program is an intensive summer experience designed to encourage 
motivated pre-college students to explore mathematics. During those weeks, 
students are immersed in a world of mathematical discovery.

[Dr. Arnold Ross](/alumni/biography/ "Ross Biography") founded this 
multi-level program at Notre Dame University in 1957\. Its growth was 
then spurred by the launch of the Sputnik satellite and the subsequent 
surge of interest in science education. Arnold Ross’s Program has run 
every summer since then, associated mostly with Ohio State University 
from 1964 through 2018. In 2019 the Program moved to 
<a href="http://www.ohiodominican.edu/"> Ohio Dominican University</a>,
and in 2020 the program was entirely online.  

Our central goal has always been to instruct bright young students in the art of mathematical thinking and to inspire them to discover for themselves that abstract ideas are valuable and important. First year participants take the basic course in number theory. For most students, this is the first time they are asked to consider entirely new questions, to develop methods that they have not seen before, and to justify every answer.

The value of a mathematics education lies not only in obtaining proficiency in computational tasks, but also in building a foundation for critical thinking. Students who have never asked why things work the way they do are not prepared to lead the way to future scientific innovation. It is precisely this independence of thought and questioning attitude that the Ross Program strives to nurture.

**Ross Program in Asia.**  
The _Ross/Asia_ program has been cancelled for 2021.  
In 2022 we hope to be able to offer a Ross session at a location in China or in a country nearby.



## Eligibility

Ambitious pre-college students with interests in mathematics and science are invited 
to [apply](/students/to-apply.md/). First-year students range in age from 15 to 18 years old. 
(In rare cases, younger or older students are accepted.)  Admission decisions are based 
on several criteria, including: school transcripts; teacher recommendations;  
essays concerning the applicant’s interests and goals; and the applicant’s 
work on some challenging math problems. 

Undergraduate math majors and math graduate students are invited 
to [apply to be a Ross Counselor](/counselors/).

NOTE. The Ross Program cannot accommodate students who must arrive more than two days after the start of classes.

## Costs and Financial Aid

Each Ross student is asked to pay a program fee of $1500.  Those funds are used to hire instructors and counselors, and also cover costs for developing new courses.

NOTE: [Financial aid](https://rossprogram.org/students/faq/#are-scholarships-available) 
is available. Accepted applicants are encouraged to apply if their families have some 
financial need. We hope to provide enough support to enable every 
accepted applicant to attend this great Program.   

## To Apply

Each January, the Ross Program application is posted on the [to apply](/students/to-apply.md/) page. 
In March, The Ross Admissions Committee starts the admissions process.  
The final application deadline is April 1. <br>
The Admissions Committee will start making acceptance offers in mid-April, and the process should
be completed by May. 

The Ross Program admits students of any race, color, gender, and national or ethnic origin.
