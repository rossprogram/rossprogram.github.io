The first year course in the Ross Program is organized around a series of daily problem sets in number theory. 
These sets invite the participants to contemplate a variety of seemingly simple questions about numbers 
and their relationships. As the summer progresses the students are encouraged to investigate these 
questions in increasing depth, and to return to them periodically as their skill at abstract reasoning 
and their collection of available tools become more powerful.

This spiraling of concepts is summarized in the Ross Program's motto:

_"Think deeply about simple things."_

To realize this idea, we concentrate on one central theme, rather than touching lightly 
on many disjoint mathematical topics. Ross students spend the entire summer 
focusing their attention on integers and their properties.

The term begins with investigations of topics involving prime numbers and modular arithmetic. 
Participants observe curious numerical properties and search for satisfactory explanations of them. 
Starting from a list of "axioms", they learn how to write proofs that are rigorous and complete. 
Even the simplest of those proofs might become important later in the term, 
when similar ideas are investigated in other contexts.

After examining concrete numerical examples, students identify patterns and then formulate 
general algebraic statements that include those numerical examples as special cases. 
They work to prove that those statements are true, and then use those proofs to help 
explain new observations. Eventually they encounter versions of the original questions 
in other contexts and begin to appreciate them from a deeper perspective. 
Some of these investigations lead to significant insights into the structure 
of number systems and the underpinnings of algebraic formalism. By considering 
simply stated questions from several directions, participants attain some 
understanding of how professional mathematicians and scientists work: 
gathering data, looking for patterns and analogies, making conjectures, 
and finally testing and proving those conjectures.

Students should expect to get deeply involved in intensive, mathematical work. 
Although formal classes take up only eight hours per week, Ross participants 
work hard during the many hours of unstructured time. They think about the many 
mathematical problems, and struggle with the difficulties. After a lot of effort 
they finally develop methods of thought that will prove useful in many aspects of their scientific lives.

To provide an idea of the level of mathematics involved, here is a copy of one of the 
Ross Program [problem sets](http://u.osu.edu/rossmath/files/2014/08/set02.web-19zutzo.pdf). 
The [range of topics](https://rossprogram.org/students/course-topics/) discussed in the 
Ross Number Theory course also indicates the depth and scope of this fast-paced but rigorous course.

# Advanced Students and Counselors

For such an intensely problem-based approach to succeed, students need 
careful and personal feedback on their work. This job is done by the Ross counselors, 
who live in the dormitories along with the younger participants.

Counselors are undergraduate math majors or graduate students who are studying mathematics 
and science at some of the best colleges and universities. Each counselor contributes a 
tremendous amount of time and energy working directly with several first year students. 
In addition to their jobs as student advisors, counselors add to the Program's atmosphere 
of mathematical excitement by participating in advanced courses and by presenting their 
own "dorm courses". The counselors' enthusiasm is contagious, and they try to bring all 
participants together to form a true community. But ultimately much of this task falls 
to the students. It is the students themselves who devote their time and energy to meet the challenges set for them.

Beginning students who do well are invited to return as junior counselors or counselors 
in subsequent summers. Advanced first-year students, junior counselors, and counselors 
take advanced courses which vary from year to year.

Many alumni of the Ross Program have kept in contact with us. Some of their enthusiasm 
for the Program is evident in their comments posted on the [alumni news and comments page](/alumni/news/).
