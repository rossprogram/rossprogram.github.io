Participants in this six-week summer course attend class 
for ten hours per week (five in lecture and five in small-group meetings). 
Apart from those classes, students structure their own time, 
with the understanding that they will spend many hours concentrating 
on the challenging mathematical ideas presented in class and on the problem sets.

After solving a problem, students are asked to write clear and accurate proofs 
of all their assertions. This practice with logical thinking and experience 
in mathematical writing will be of great use in abstract science and mathematics courses taken in college.

Number Theory was chosen as the central topic for the Ross Program because many of its ideas 
are close to the surface and easily noticed, but deeper concepts and connections 
are available for exploration. Ross participants investigate this _one_ subject deeply 
and at length. Although students might not encounter these topics in standard high school 
or college courses, there is tremendous value in the experience of delving deeply into one subject.

The topics mentioned below appear throughout the problem sets, with different topic-threads 
often appearing on the same set. By investigating a sequence of related problems over several days, 
students observe patterns, make conjectures, explore further examples to test the conjectures, 
formulate theorems, write up proofs, polish the arguments, and investigate generalizations.

Students proceed at various paces through the problem sets. In fact, few students are able t
o master all the ideas and techniques the first time they see them. The Ross counselors 
strive to build a "community of scholars" in the dormitory, encouraging everyone to work 
on these challenging mathematical ideas, to share their ideas and insights, and to experience 
the joy of solving a difficult problem.
