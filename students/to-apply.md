# Instructions

The application portal will open in early 2024.

## Commitment to Nondiscrimination

The Ross Program does not discriminate on the basis of gender, gender
identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, creed, color,
ethnic origin, disability, or marital status in its admissions,
educational programming, financial aid, employment practices, or other
activities.

We recognize the existing gender and racial disparities within the mathematics community. In our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment, we highly encourage applications from individuals of underrepresented backgrounds.

## Application Deadline
  
The deadline for Ross applications is **March 31**. Applications submitted 
after that date might not receive full consideration.

The Ross Admissions Committee will start reading applications on April 1.  Acceptance
decisions will be emailed later that month.
  

## Financial Information

The fee to attend the 2024 Ross/USA Program is $7000. That fee covers 
all room and board costs and all instructional expenses. 

## Scholarships

The Ross Program endeavors to provide enough financial support to
enable every accepted student to attend. If you have been accepted to
the Ross Program and need financial assistance in order to join us,
please ask your parent or guardian to contact us at
